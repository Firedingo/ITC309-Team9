### Non-disclosure agreement

Confirmed as not required for this project by DPI. Team is not held up waiting for access to resources.

### Inception Phase Goals/Outcomes

MD discussed the goals and outcomes of the Inception Phase of the project.  Should be the shortest phase of the project. If it is too long it may indicate that the upfront specification is too excessive (for a unified process project). Specification will be extended in the elaboration phase. Use the information that we have to complete the documents for the current assessment and then revise for the third assessment.

MD provided links to some diagram examples and chapters relevant to the current document set. The requirements document is the most complex and as such there are more resources for that. There is a post on the ITC303 forum with the links as well. 

#### Links:

- Wikipedia: [Unified Process: Inception Phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process#Inception_phase)
- CSU E-Book: [System Analysis and Design 7E (ProQuest)](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/csuau/detail.action?docID=4771015)
- CSU E-Book: [Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction 5E (ProQuest)](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/csuau/detail.action?docID=5746446)

The marking rubrics from the Subject outline should guide the documents that we return for the Inception Phase.

### Platform/Development Architecture

The team discussed the chosen development language, React Native, and the alternative that was considered, Flutter. React Native was chosen due to the maturity of the graphing libraries that are available for it. Some team members also have experience with React development. Both development platforms provide multi-platform development. React Native uses Javascript for development which is compiled into native code. The team will also need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, and AWS for deployment.

Learning process for the development technology can be included in the project plan. Also the risk of not completing the required learning can be added to the Risk List document.

### New Repository

MD needs access to the new repository that the team has migrated to. Email address is mdahshan@outlook.com. 

### Technology Competency Demonstrator

Discussed the Technology Competency Demonstrator again. Team is aiming to put together a simple app and list skills for team members. Some team members have experience with React Native, but most will need to do some learning. MD is happy with the current plan.

### Blogs/Wiki

Ensure that assessment blog is updated every two weeks. Wiki links need to be updated to allow MD to access items easily.

### Wrap up

If the team needs help we should mention MD on the Discord channel. Team confirmed that we think we can finish the Inception phase by the 19th of April.

Next meeting will be on the 28th of April. The meeting after that may need to be rescheduled as MD may be away.
