# Inception Phase Project Status Assessment

## 1. Assessment against Objectives of the Inception Phase 

### 1.1 Do we know what we are trying to achieve?
The aim of the project is to develop a mobile application to provide quick and easy access to graphically represented climate data from IoT sensors. This is embodied in the completed Vision Document.
We understand the main functional requirements of the project which are:

- View Estuary Water Quality 
- View Environmental Conditions (CCRD) 
- View Sensor 
- View Sensor History 
- View Environmental History 
- View Rainfall Triggers 
- Set Current Location 
- Add Favourite Location 
- View Map of Locations 
- View Map of Sensors

This is shown in the completed Functional Requirement model embodied in `<insert list of artefacts documenting Functional Requirements here>`
We understand the main Non-Functional requirements of the project which are:
`<insert prioritised list of NFRs here (max 7)>`
This is shown in the completed Non-Functional Requirement model embodied in `<insert list of artefacts documenting Non-Functional Requirements here>`

### 1.2 Do we know how we are going to achieve it?
We have a good idea of how we are going to achieve our aims. We are going to use a `<insert brief summary of architecture here>`. This is shown in the completed `<insert list of artefacts documenting architecture here>`
We have a good understanding of the project specific risks facing our project and how we are going to deal with them. The risks are:
`<insert prioritised list of project specific risks here (max 7)>`
Our evolving understanding of risks is shown in the ongoing risk list and discussed further below in Section 4.
We have a good understanding of how we are going to check that our application delivers the intended functionality and system properties. Our key areas of concern and the test strategies we will use to address these concerns are as follows:
`<insert list of areas of concern and test strategies addressing those concerns>`
This is shown in the completed Master Test Plan
We have a good understanding of the dependencies and likely completion times for different parts of the project. Target completion dates for key aspects of the project are as follows:
  
  - **6th June** Life Cycle Architecture Milestone (LCAM) and completion of Elaboration Phase 
  - **3rd September**  Initial Operation Capability Milestone (IOCM) and completion of Construction Phase 
  - **13th October** Product Release Milestone (PRM) and completion of Transition Phase / Project End 

This is shown in the Initial Project Plan.

### 1.3 Skills required
Our project requires skills using the following key tools and technologies:

- React Native application 
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
- FarmDecisionTech REST API. 
- BitBucket Source Code Repository 
- Jira Project Management Software 

We have demonstrated that we have the skills to use these technologies through the implementation of a technology competency demonstrator.

 
## 2. Deliverables
For each deliverable:
### 2.x <insert Document/Artefact name here>. 
`<identify any key points you wish to make about this particular deliverable>`
`<identify any issues encountered in producing the Document/Artefact, otherwise report as ‘No Issues’>`

### 2.1 Project Vision
The project vision proved challenging due to a large level of variation between the Assessment Outline, the provided template, and the textbook resource. Following the template guide and attempting a combination of the requirements listed in the subject outline and method provided in the textbook, the Project Vision is a best attempt. The project vision requires further work in the Elaboration phase to ensure the business case is clear.

### 2.2 Initial Requirement Model


### 2.3 Proposed Architecture
The stakeholders originally requested a mobile app, however during our meeting with them it became clear we needed a web application. The proposed architecure included an analysis of options and reasoning for our choice to proceed with React Native.

### 2.4 Risk List
Delayed.

### 2.5 Master Test Plan
Delayed.

### 2.6 Initial Project Plan
The project plan had to account for delays at the start of semester. As such the project is currently behind schedule. The plan has been updated and sprints during the Elaboration phases will be only 12 days, which is less convenient for scheduling sprint conclusion and assessments, however is necessary to ensure completion of the assessment by the end of semester.
The plan only covers a high-level overview of project objectives, however

### 2.7 Technical Competency Demonstrator
No issues.

## 3. General Issues
For each issue

### 3.1 Team Communication
Whilst recognising they chaotic and delayed start to semester, and the external pressures (such as work, family, etc.) it remains important to keep the team updated on progress of work items. This is an ongoing issue to be monitored and discussed at team meetings.

### 3.2 Requirements
The stakeholders have given the team a large amount of freedom in determining the best solution. Whilst it is exciting to creatively develop a new product, there is a lot of information gathering necessary to determine the requriements. Unfortunately, due to the relatively short time frame of the Inception phases, this research was not thorough. Our understanding of the requirements has been a best guess effort based on publicly accessible information on the DPI websites, and our meeting with the stakeholder. Further clarification is needed to confirm our understanding of the requirements is correct. This is an ongoing issue to be raised in the team meeting and communicated with the stakeholders.

### 3.3 Potential lack of cohesiveness
Due to the rush to complete this overdue assessment there has potentially been inadequate discussion amongst the team to ensure tasks and documents are aligned. The documents all support each other and rely on the same information, and we have not taken due time to ensure we have a shared understanding of this information. This issue will be monitored as we develop improved versions of these documents during the Elaboration phase.


### 3.x `<insert Issue name here>`
`<identify any key points you wish to make about this particular non-deliverable-associated issue>`
`<say whether the issue is ongoing or resolved – if ongoing say what you are doing to monitor and manage it>`
## 4. Risks
For each risk (max 7)
### 4.x <insert risk name here>
`<identify any key points you wish to make about this particular risk>`
`<state the mitigation strategy you are using to address the risk>`
`<say whether the risk is ongoing or resolved>`


## 5 Summary – Overall Project Progress
`<Summarise your progress against the aims of the Inception Phase>`
The project is currently behind schedule. The project plan has been updated to reflect shorter iterations to ensure the project can still be completed by the end of the course, however diligence is required to maintain this schedule.
`<Summarise the status of any ongoing issues>`  
Issues are mainly regarding project management, and will be discussed at the team meeting.   
`<Summarise the status of any ongoing risks>`
