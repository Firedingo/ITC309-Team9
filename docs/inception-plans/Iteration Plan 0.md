### Assessment against objectives

Yes the objectives were addressed. Not completely but mostly.


### Work Items: Planned compared to actually completed

All work items were attempted. Most items were done in one sitting and completed, though due to the delay in getting a project, not all work items were completed or addressed in a timely manner.


### Assessment against Evaluation Criteria Test results

Most evaluation criteria was met with minimal issues, however the sixth criteria was not met. This is primarily sue to the fact that 2 work items while mostly done remain incomplete due to additional information needing to be added to both documents still. This is partially the result of being delayed getting a project and therefore understanding what is involved with it, with a meeting with the project sponsor only being held days before items were initially due. Additional team meetings may have helped to push the items to competition though some contacts at the project sponsor were also unavailable for a period of time and not all questions were satisfactorily answered by the sponsor thus leaving a giant question mark over some aspects of two of the deliverables.


### Other concerns and deviations
