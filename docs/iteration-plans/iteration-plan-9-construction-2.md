### Objectives Assessment

Majority of high level objectives were met. Item 3, Foundational Requirements Was Not Met. It was primarily dependent on Criteria 3 & 4.

### Work Items Assessment

Most Work Items Were Completed. Items 10 & 11 remain outstanding. Both items were also essentially more meaty than previous items. The encountered issues contributed also to the incomplete nature of these work items.

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

Most evaluation criteria was met. Criteria 4 was not met. Criteria 4 was dependent on work items 10 & 11 being achieved.

### Concerns and Deviations

While there are work items outstanding, they could be attributed to the encountered issue. Some concern remains still about the skill and capacity of the team to successfully deliver the project. Particularly as the team is now quite behind.
