### Objectives Assessment

No High level Objectives were met. Objective 1 is dependent on criteria 1. Objective 2 is dependent on criteria 2, 3 & 4.

### Work Items Assessment

No Work Items were completed. Item 10 was attempted, no other items were attempted. Item 12 had partial work completed in the previous iteration.

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

No Evaluation Criteria was met. Criteria 1 was dependent on work items 10 & 11. Criteria 2 was dependent on work items 12, 13, 14 & 15.

### Concerns and Deviations

There is serious concern over whether the project can be completed in time as a result of the failure to complete these work items. There is also remaining concern over whether there is adequate skills to successfully complete and deliver the project.
