## Decisions

    2. Cadastral Plan Parsing using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for [Spatial Services](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/) ([NSW Department of Customer Service](https://www.nsw.gov.au/customer-service)).
    3. Climate Change Adaption Game for [NSW Department of Primary Industries](https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/).
* The push communication platform will be [Discord](https://discord.com/).
* The version control repository will be hosted on [BitBucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) with issue tracking via [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
* The initial draft of the team charter will be collaborated on via [Google Docs](https//docs.google.com/). Upon sign-off, it (and any subsequent updates) will be committed and pushed to the version control repository.
* Work on the project proposal and iteration plan will be postponed under week two (commencing 2021-03-08), as the subject coordinator needs to allocate the project and provide further details.
* The scheduled weekly meeting will continue to be Wednesday 18:30.

## Actions
* [Benjamin](mailto:bsk888@postoffice.csu.edu.au) will create the minutes for the current (2021-03-03) meeting.
* [Benjamin](mailto:bsk888@postoffice.csu.edu.au) will contact the subject coordinator to seek clarification on the blog entries task (as such functionality is seemingly absent from the CSU Interact platform).
* [Christopher](mailto:cclark55@postoffice.csu.edu.au) will create the BitBucket version control repository and Jira issue tracking board and issue invites to all individual team members.
* [Samuel](mailto:sjohns85@postoffice.csu.edu.au) will create and share the team charter via Google Docs, with contributions made by all individual team members.
* [Christopher](mailto:cclark55@postoffice.csu.edu.au) will create the Wiki "Home" and "PMAS" pages, with contributions made by all individual team members.
