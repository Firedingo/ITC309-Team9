The current development team has been  working in a Windows 2k environment, and the current requirements are for a  LINUX environment. The project  schedule would require 1500 development hours of a skilled LINUX operator,  and approximately 1900 to 2200 if we retrain our current resources. | EXAMPLE: If required skills are not identified or obtained, project  schedule may slip and possibly restrict the accomplishment of project goals. | Project Resources     Budget     Schedule | EXAMPLE: Schedule approaches the required start date with no  identification of required skill sets. | EXAMPLE: Four weeks prior to scheduled start date if no resource is  identified with required skill set implement contingency plan. | Mitigation                  | EXAMPLE: Find internal resource that meets required skill set or train  existing resources on LINUX. | EXAMPLE: Find resource that meets required skill set through external  hiring sources. |

| Medium: Risk that  has the potential to slightly impact project cost, project schedule or  performance. | This column should be populated  with the symptoms of risk that may eventually lead to the execution of a risk  contingency plan. |
| Low: Risk that has  relatively little impact on cost, schedule or performance. | <u>**Trigger**</u>                                           |

| **<u>Risk Map</u>**                                          | This column should  be populated with the preferred risk response strategy. |

| Yellow: LH (Low  Probability, High Impact), MM (Medium Probability, Medium Impact), HL (High  Probability, Low Impact) | This column should be  populated an appropriate response strategy to prevent the risk from becoming  an issue. |
