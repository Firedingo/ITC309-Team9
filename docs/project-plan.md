# Clyde River Dashboard Project
## Project Plan

## 1. Introduction
`[Briefly describe the content of the project plan.]`

## 2. Project Organisation
`[Introduce the project team, team members, and roles that they play during this project. If applicable, introduce work areas, domains, or technical work packages that are assigned to team members. Introduce neighboring projects, relationships, and communication channels. If the project is introduced somewhere else, reference that location with a link.]`

This project will be undertaken by **Team 2** consisting of Benjamin Cummings, Christopher Clark, Naomi Thompson, and Samuel Johnson. We will be working with Department of Primary Industry to provide a mobile application.

## 3. Project practices and measurements 
`[Describe or reference which management and technical practices will be used in the project, such as iterative development, continuous integration, independent testing and list any changes or particular configuration to the project. Specify how you will track progress in each practice. As an example, for iterative development the team may decide to use iteration assessments and iteration burndown reports and collect metrics such as velocity (completed work item points/ iteration).`

## 4. Deployment
`[Outline the strategy for deploying the software (and its updates) into the production environment.]`

## 5. Project milestones and objectives
`[Define and describe the high-level objectives for the iterations and define milestones. For example, use the following table to lay out the schedule. Generic goals are provided as a guide. You should expand/replace these with your own project specific goals.] `
