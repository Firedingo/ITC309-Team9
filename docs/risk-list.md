## Key:

| <u>ID</u>                                                    | <u>Project Impact</u>                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A unique ID number used to identify the risk in the risk tracking log. | This column should be populated with a description of the potential project impact as a result of the risk. |
| **<u>Status</u>**                                            | **<u>Risk Area</u>**                                         |
| Open: The risk is currently open but is not yet an issue.    | This column should be populated with the appropriate risk area. **Valid Options: Project, Budget, Schedule/Delivery, Technology, Resources, Miscellaneous** |
| Closed: The risk is no longer considered an active project threat and can be closed with or without resolution. | <u>**Symptoms**</u>                                          |
| <u>**Risk Impact**</u>                                       | This column should be populated with the symptoms of risk that may eventually lead to the execution of a risk contingency plan. |
| High: Risk that has the potential to greatly impact project cost, project schedule or performance. | <u>**Trigger**</u>                                           |
| Medium: Risk that has the potential to slightly impact project cost, project schedule or performance. | This column should be populated with the triggers that would indicate the requirement to execute contingency plans. |
| Low: Risk that has relatively little impact on cost, schedule or performance. | <u>**Risk Response Strategy**</u>                            |
| <u>**Probability  of Occurrence**</u>                        | This column should  be populated with the preferred risk response strategy. **Valid Options: Mitigate, Avoid, Transfer, Actively Accept, Passively Accept, and Escalate Risk** |
| This column should be populated with the estimated probability that the risk will at some point become a project issue. | **<u>Response Strategy</u>**                                 |
| **<u>Risk Map</u>**                                          | This column should be populated an appropriate response strategy to prevent the risk from becoming an issue. |
| Green: LL (Low  Probability, Low Impact), LM (Low Probability, Medium Impact), ML (Medium Probability, Low Impact) | **<u>Contingency Plan</u>**                                  |
| Yellow: LH (Low Probability, High Impact), MM (Medium Probability, Medium Impact), HL (High Probability, Low Impact) | This column should be populated with a description of the risk contingency plan. |
| Red: MH (Medium Probability, High Impact), HM (High Probability Medium Impact), HH (High Probability, High Impact) |                                                              |
