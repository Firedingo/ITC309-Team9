## 5. Issues

| **Issue**                                       | **Status** | **Notes**                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small Charts Can't Render Large Amounts Of Data | Unresolved | Too much data on small charts causes the application to break. Additional functionality will be needed in order to reduce the amount of data sent to small aka summary charts. Data is uploaded about every 15 minutes. Proposal to use a quarter of that data aka 1 data point per hour or thereabouts. |

### Objectives Assessment

While half the objectives being completed is good. Ultimately the project is a failure as much remains outstanding and incomplete.

In particular it is of note that Objective 1 and 2 have not been completed while Objectives 3 & 4 have been.

- Objective 1 is dependent on Criteria 1, 2 & 5.
- Objective 2 is dependent on Criteria 3.
- Objective 3 is dependent on Criteria 4.
- Objective 4 is dependent on Criteria 6.

### Work Items Assessment

Overall the work items were not well finished and key important work items were not completed. Of note is items 15 and 16 as well as 27.

Work Items 31 & 32 were discovered late yet would have made a profound impact on the final delivery.

It however is good to see work items 17, 28 & 29 complete.

It simply came down to the fact the team has run out of time to complete the remaining work items.

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

While half the criteria have been met, it is still concerning that a major part of the plan's criteria haven't been met.

Of note is Criterias 2, 4 & 6 which were met while criterias 1, 3 & 5  were not met.

- Criteria 1 is dependent on Work Items 15 & 16.
- Criteria 2 is dependent on Work Item 17.
- Criteria 3 is dependent on Work Items 27, 28 & 30.
- Criteria 4 is dependent on Work Item 29.
- Criteria 5 is dependent on Work Items 31 & 32.
- Criteria 6 is dependent on Work Item 33, 34 & 35.

### Concerns and Deviations

Like each iteration before, the concern is over whether the team can deliver the project and as this iteration clearly spells out, they can not.

While much progress was made, the project is ultimately a failure.

Key factors that have contributed to this are the lack of team members, the inexperience of the 1 team member as well as the compressed time, the redesign of the project and the turbulent start this project began with.

Personal & health reasons have also contributed to reduced capacity to work, particularly as the team has approached the end here.
