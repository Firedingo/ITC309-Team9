## Charter Purpose

Our team is composed of members with differing backgrounds and experiences who have not previously worked with each other. Due to this, there are no past experiences to draw upon, and our team dynamic is lacking alignment.

This charter defines a set of agreements (i.e. the single source of truth) which aims to create alignment (with regards to goals, responsibilities, values, etc.), clarity, commitment, and engagement amongst the members of our team.

## Team Purpose

Our team has been assembled to collaborate on, and complete to a high standard and in a timely manner, the assessments (which relate to the *“Clyde River Dashboard”* project sponsored by the Department of Primary Industries) within the *“ITC303 Software Development Project 1”* subject offered by Charles Sturt University. Accordingly, the members of our team will have exposure to, and have the opportunity to increase proficiency with, the unified process (UP) and associated development best practices that contribute to the production of high quality software solutions that are fit for purpose.

## Goals

1. Create a team that collaborates and communicates effectively and efficiently, and supports each other in achieving our common and personal goals.
2. Simulate a real-world software development environment that effectively prepares each member of this team for the demands of professional software production.
3. Utilise project management, development, testing, and deployment technologies, tools, and methodologies that are current and relevant to the industry.
4. Complete the assigned assessment tasks, and associated deliverables, to a high standard and on time (i.e. before the due date specified within the subject outline).
5. Provide demonstrable evidence of how the team meets the success criteria for all of the assessments described within the subject outline.
6. Complete the software development project by following the principles, phases, and milestones defined by the unified process (UP).

## Expectations

Each member of this team shall commit to, and abide by, the following principles and behaviours while undertaking their team roles and responsibilities during the course of this subject:

1. Attend weekly scheduled team meetings, fortnightly scheduled supervisor meetings, and on-demand sponsor meetings. If a member is unable to attend (and an alternate date and time cannot be accommodated by the team, supervisor, or sponsor), decision making rights are forfeited and delegated to those in attendance. Additionally, best efforts should be made by the member to provide advanced notice of their absence and a progress report to the team via the specified communication channels.
2. Workload is equitably shared. Each team member should be given the opportunity to expand his/her skill set through varying roles.
3. Act maturely and professionally when interacting with other members.
4. Undertake assigned tasks with integrity and at all times avoiding plagiarism.
5. Maintain transparency with regards to progress and status of their assigned work items.
6. Be punctual and ensure prompt completion of assigned work items.
7. Avoid “blocker” issues for work items that are critical dependencies, and notify the team as soon as possible when such issues occur.
8. Give and receive artefact and code review feedback as constructive criticism in a respectful and professional manner and not as a personal attack on the person’s skills and knowledge.
9. Operate in the best interests of the team and provide assistance/guidance to others as required.
10. When conflict arises, each member expects that it will be resolved in a fair and unbiased manner inline with the defined conflict resolution processes.
11. Respond to and acknowledge any urgent issues and concerns raised via the team’s push notification application within 24 hours.
12. Maintain written records of every team-level decision, issue, and action point raised during team, supervisor, and sponsor meetings.
13. Consult with the other team members prior to making any changes to their assigned work items.
14. Review and contribute to the completion and maintenance of any assigned deliverables, artefacts, or work items assigned to other team members (as appropriate).
15. Deliverables will be of the highest quality that meets the criteria listed under the assessment’s rubric table (see the subject outline).

## Rights

Each member has the right to:

1. Experience varied roles and responsibilities throughout the lifecycle of the project.
2. Voice their opinions, concerns, and feedback without the fear of being berated, ridiculed, or ignored.
3. Be heard and counted into every team-level decision.
4. Be allocated realistic delivery time based on the person’s skill level.
5. Be notified of any changes in circumstances relating to dependent work items which may influence delivery times.
6. Provide feedback on content related to assessment deliverables, artefacts, or work items assigned to other team members.
7. Be given an equitable share of responsibilities for any assessment deliverables, artefacts, or work items.
8. Decide on the best solution for an individually assigned work item, as long as that decision does not negatively impact the work items assigned to other team members.
9. Seek advice from the other team members.

## Responsibilities and Roles

To facilitate each team member gaining experience in all areas of the software development process, the roles will be assigned based on individual strengths and preferences, and rotated as needed.

## Operating Procedures

### Scheduled Meetings

Weekly scheduled team meetings will be on Thursday at 6:00PM (AEST/AEDT). Target duration will be thirty minutes (this may be extended if necessary and unanimously agreed to by the attendees). Additional meetings may be organised if required to meet an upcoming deadline.

Fortnightly scheduled supervisor meetings will be Thursday at 5:00PM (AEST/AEDT) and occur on the odd weeks within the semester (i.e. week 1, 3, 5, etc.). Target duration will be one hour.

Occasionally, on-demand sponsor meetings may be required at the conclusion of an iteration, milestone, or phase. Target duration will vary based on the agenda.

A list of agenda items should be submitted to the group via the push communication platform (i.e. Discord) prior to a meeting. The team member assigned as the scribe for the week (whether on a fixed or flexible basis) shall record these agenda items within the meeting minutes (as detailed below).

Before covering any new items, any outstanding action items from the previous week’s meeting must be reviewed and managed by the team before it becomes critical.

The meeting scribe will be responsible for recording the meeting minutes. Items that must be recorded include decisions and action points. Action points must be owned by an assigned member who is responsible for completing the required action within the agreed time. Issues that may prevent the timely completion of the action point must be raised with the team via the push communication platform (i.e. Discord) to allow the team to assist with, re-assign, or escalate the issue.

The meeting minutes will be shared by the scribe with the rest of the team using the push communication platform (i.e. Discord) for review. Once signed-off, the scribe will commit the minutes to the version control repository.

### Communication Channels

| Type                            | Application or Platform                                |

| Work Item Feedback              | BitBucket and Jira                                     |

### Decision Making

* Team-related decisions will be made by consensus.
* Code review (i.e. pull request) outcomes will be made as follows:
    * Minimum of two reviewers per pull request.
    * Only one reviewer needs to approve the pull request for it to be mergeable (on the assumption that another reviewer hasn’t previously rejected it).

### Conflict Resolution

* Grievances or issues will be raised for discussion by the entire team as soon as possible and included in the meeting agenda.
* Decisions will be based on consensus by the group and details of the reasoning behind that decision shall be documented within the meeting minutes.

### 3-Strike Policy

A 3-strike policy will be adopted to enforce accountability:

1. The first infraction incurs a warning by the CSU email (i.e. post office) system and is recorded within the meeting minutes.
2. The second infraction incurs another warning (as per the first infraction) and a notification is sent to the project supervisor.
3. The third infraction incurs another warning (as per the first infraction) and the decision to expel the member will be at the discretion of the remaining team. Depending on the outcome, the project supervisor will be notified.

An infraction is any action or behaviour that defies the defined expectations.

### Conflict Escalation

In situations where conscious efforts to resolve conflict within the team are no longer deemed possible, the grievance will be referred to the project supervisor.

### Reflection

The team will conduct a retrospective review meeting following the completion of each iteration/sprint to reflect on the group’s performance and identify any potential areas of improvement.

Consideration will be given to the subject’s assessment criteria and associated work items.

### Development Environment

TODO.
