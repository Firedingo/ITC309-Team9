# 1	Introduction

## 1.1	Project and project objective

A mobile application that takes data already being returned from sensors on the Clyde River and surrounding area and display it in a format that's much easier and nicer to understand. The application will interface with a pre-existing API supplied by the sponsor in order to access this data. The main aim is to take what already exists and just make it better, ie more accessible, user friendly and easier to understand and interpret. Also more practical for farmers in the field to use.

## 1.2	Objective of the master test plan

The objective of the Master Test Plan (MTP) is to inform all who are involved in the test process about the approach, the activities, including the mutual relations and dependencies, and the (end) products to be delivered.

The master test plan describes the test approach, the activities and (end) products.

# 2	Documentation

This chapter describes the documentation used in relation with the master test plan. The described documentation concerns a first inventory and will be elaborated, actualized and detailed at a later stage, during the separate test levels.

## 2.1	Basis for the master test plan

The following documents are used as basis for this master test plan.

## 2.2	Test basis

The test basis contains the documentation that serves as basis for the tests that have to be executed. The overview below describes the documentation that is the starting point for testing. 

| **Document  name**                                  | **Version** | **Date** | **Author**  |

There may be additional documentation yet to be defined and created that is relevant for this section. Likely further interviews with the stakeholder Department of Primary Industries will be needed to further clarify project requirements which will influence testing procedures going forward.

# 3	Test strategy

The time available for testing is limited; not everything can be tested with equal thoroughness. This means that choices have to be made regarding the depth of testing. Also, it is strived to divide test capacity as effective and efficient as possible over the total test project. This principle is the basis of the test strategy.

The test strategy is based on risks: a system has to function in practice to an extent that no unacceptable risks for the organization arise from it. If the delivery of a system brings along many risks, thorough testing needs to be put in place; the opposite of the spectrum is also true: 'no risk, no test'.

The first step in determining the test strategy is the execution of a product risk analyses. This is elaborated in ยง3.1.

The test strategy is subsequently based on the results of the risk analyses. The test strategy lays down what, how and when (in which test level) is being tested and is focused in finding the most important defects as early as possible for the lowest costs. This can be summarized as testing with an optimal use of the available capacity and time. The test strategy is described in ยง3.3.

## 3.1	Risk analyses

### 3.1.1	Product Risk Analysis

The product risks are determined in cooperation with the client and the other parties involved. Product risks are those risks associated with the final product failing to meet functional requirements and required system quality characteristics (NFRs) This product risk analyses (PRA) is comprised of two steps:

 

| **Product Risk** | **Characteristic** | **Description**                                              | Probability | Impact | **Risk  Class** |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |

| 2               | Usability               | The interface does not display graph information within 10 seconds | Medium         | Low            | D              |

| 14 |                    |                                                              |             |        |                 |
| 15 |                    |                                                              |             |        |                 |

| 17 |                         |                                                              |                 |                 |                 |
| 18 |                         |                                                              |                 |                 |                 |

The extent of the risk (the risk class) is dependent on the chance of failure (how big the chance is that it goes wrong?) and it depends on the damage for the organization if it actually occurs.

Key:

- A = HH (High, High)
- B = HM (High, Medium), MH (Medium, High)
- C = MM (Medium, Medium), LH (Low, High), HL (High, Low)
- D = LM (Low, Medium), ML (Medium, Low)
- E = LL (Low, Low)

 

### 3.1.2	Technical Risk Analysis

Technical risks are determined in cooperation with the analyst/designers and programmers involved. Technical risks are development risks associated with failing to create a system that behaves according to specifications derived from requirements. (I.E. those aspects of development that pose particular challenges.) This technical risk analyses (TRA) is comprised of two steps:

 

| **Technical risk** | **Risk  Area**          | **Description**                                              | Probability | Impact | **Risk  Class** |

- E = LL (Low, Low)



## 3.2	Test strategy

For each risk from the product and technical risk analysis the risk class determines the thoroughness of the test. Risk class A is the highest risk class and E the lowest. The test strategy is subsequently focused on covering the risks with the highest risk class as early as possible in the test project.

NOTE: 

- A = At least 1 OOOOO
- B = At least 1 OOOO
- C = At least 1 OOO
- D = At least 1 OO
- E = At least 1 O

# 4	Test Levels

For this MTP the following test levels are acknowledged:

| **Test level**        | **Goal**                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unit testing:         | The aim is to test each part of the software by separating it. It checks that component are fulfilling functionalities or not |
| Integration  testing: | In this testing  phase, different software modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure that integrated system is ready for system testing. Integrating testing checks the data flow from one module to other modules. |
| System testing:       | System testing is  performed on a complete, integrated system. It allows checking system's  compliance as per the requirements. It tests the overall interaction of components. It involves load, performance, reliability and security testing. |
| Acceptance  testing:  | Acceptance testing is a test conducted to find if the requirements of a specification or contract are met as per its delivery. |
