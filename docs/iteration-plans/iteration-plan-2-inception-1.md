| Iteration plan document was incorrect.            | Resolved   | The time period and work items related to assessment item 1, instead of assessment item 2.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FarmDecisionTech API returning invalid responses. | Unresolved | The endpoint `/tenant/assets` endpoint throws an exception when an optional offset isn't specified. The endpoint `/asset/{assetId}` returns a `200 (OK)` response when an invalid asset ID is specified, where as it should return a `404 (Not Found)` response. |

### Objectives Assessment

The high-level objectives were partially achieved.

### Work Items Assessment

All work items were attempted. However, the architecture notebook and requirement model documents remain incomplete due to underestimating the amount of time and effort involved.

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

All evaluation criteria was satisfied with the exception of the completion of the architecture notebook and requirement model documents.

### Concerns and Deviations

The project is behind schedule, which will hopefully be corrected in the subsequent iteration.
