# Functional Requirements

## High Priority

- The system shall allow farmers to view the current salinity level recorded by a water quality sensor.
- The system shall allow farmers to view the current temperature recorded by a water quality sensor.
- The system shall allow farmers to view the precipitation for a specified time period as recorded for a location.



### Optional Extras

- The system shall allow farmers to view the salinity levels for a specified time period as recorded by a water quality sensor.
- The system shall allow farmers to view the temperatures for a specified time period as recorded by a water quality sensor.



## Medium Priority

- The system shall allow farmers to view the current salinity levels recorded by all water quality sensors in the estuary. Salinity levels from upstream and downstream of a farmers lease.
- The system shall allow farmers to view the current temperature levels recorded by all water quality sensors in the estuary.
- The system shall allow farmers to see if salinity has fallen below or exceed defined limits. Farmers will use this information to understand why a harvest area may be closed or open.



### Optional Extras

- The system shall allow farmers to see if rainfall has exceeded the defined 7 day limit. Farmers will use this information to understand why a harvest area may be closed.
- The system shall allow farmers to see if rainfall has exceeded the defined 24 hour limit. Farmers will use this information to understand why a harvest area may be closed.



## Low Priority

- The system shall allow farmers to select a location. The system would use the selection to display sensor information from that location.
- The system shall allow farmers to set a favourite location. This favourite setting will be stored and used when the application is opened to set the default location
- The system shall allow farmers to view the current favourite location setting.



## Justifications

The 3 high priority requirements have been chosen as it has been deemed from previous meetings with the DPI that oysters are most sensitive to salinity levels. The Food Authority website also contains much information on the fact there are allowable limits to salinity in which oysters are deemed acceptable and appropriate and safe to harvest.

As determined from previous meetings with DPI, rainfall has a big impact on the salinity level and therefore would be deemed a priority data point alongside salinity.

Temperature while non-specific has been shown to be detrimental to all living creatures when it reaches extremes of either end and it is not unreasonable to assume that oysters being much smaller are probably a lot more sensitive to temperature which in turn would impact the quality of product that the farmers would be able to harvest and sell.

Therefore being able to view these 3 data quality points would be highly advantageous and useful.

The 3 medium priority requirements simply build on to the 3 high priority requirements and allow further usefulness of the available data.

While all the data is useful, it is most useful when localized for a specific location for the end user, in this case the farmer. Thus the 3 low priority requirements simply add additional functionality and expand upon the previous high and medium priority points by allowing the data to be localized and more specific to the end user aka the farmer.

The optional extras are functional requirements that would be good to add to the functionality and features of the application but may or may not get added depending on time. In the case of the high priority optional extras, the likelihood of adding them is somewhat greater than for medium priority as one high priority requirement (see point 3) is likely to lay the foundation for the optional extras.

There were only 3 low priority requirements and therefore there are no remaining requirements to be included as optional extras.
