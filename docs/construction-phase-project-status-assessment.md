## Introduction

The key aims of the Construction Phase are to:

- Develop the product to be sufficiently stable and mature that it can be deployed in the user community for beta user acceptance testing.
- Demonstrate that all planned functionality has been developed by successfully passing alpha stage functional acceptance testing and key system quality scenario testing.
- Produce a user manual to support beta testing
- Develop test materials to support beta testing

Achievement of these aims is embodied in the deliverables of the Initial Operational Capability Milestone. IOCM is achieved by:

1. Developing and deploying 'beta ready' version of the final application that embodies:

> *“feature complete, no known bugs”.*

The beta ready version of the application demonstrates that all intended functionality is complete and ready for end user acceptance testing to the best of the development team’s knowledge.

2. Providing supporting test evidence to justify an assertion that IOCM has been achieved.
3. Preparing test materials to support beta testing and analyse the results.
4. Delivering an attractive and informative user manual to support beta testing and eventual production operation of the application by end users.

This report assesses current project progress against these outcomes. It also summarises progress and issues faced during each iteration of the Construction Phase.

## Executive Summary

·     Is the product ready for beta testing? 

·     Is there a suite of functional acceptance test results that justifies that assertion?

·     Is there a user manual ready? 

·     Are beta test materials and feedback forms available?

## Key System Qualities & Functionality

Initial requirement analysis identified the following critical and significant system quality and functional requirements:

### System Qualities

\1.    <identify high priority system qualities (NFRs) >

<briefly summarise status of NFRs>

### Functional Requirements

\1.    <identify high priority functional requirements (Use cases)>

< briefly summarise status of use cases>



<Very briefly summarise the status of the key deliverables for the Construction Phase>

<Very briefly summarise any remaining risks faced by the project and their current status>

 <Very briefly summarise the key issues faced by the team and their current status>



## 1. Deliverables

### 1.1 Beta Ready Version Of The Product

<Identify system qualities and use cases implemented and their status. Explain any mismatch between intended outcomes and outcomes achieved. Refer to version control repository where source code for application can be found, and a link for a ‘walk through’ video recording demonstrating achieved functionality>

### 1.2 Supporting Test Evidence

### 1.2.1 Functional Acceptance Tests

<Identify the FATs carried out to test successful completion of beta ready system. Include links to evidence>

### 1.2.2 System Quality Scenarios

<Identify any system quality scenario testing carried out to test successful support of key NFRs in the beta ready system. Include links to evidence>

### 1.3 Beta Test Materials

<Identify the ‘business scenarios’ beta testers are asked to complete. Reference the beta test materials and the feedback form used to gather and analyse the results.>

### 1.4 User Manual

<Comment on the completion status, method of delivery and quality of the user manual to be supplied to beta testers. Reference the completed user manual.>
