#### Assessment checklist

Due to delay to the start of the project we will need to have the Iteration Plan for Inception Phase 1 ready by 26th of March. We will need to complete both iterations for the Inception Phase by the 12 of April (original due date) such that we are caught up.

Commit drafts to the version control when they are ready (at the end of each iteration)

#### Project proposal

Questions about what project proposal should contain. MD advised that we should use the marking rubric from the subject outline as a guide. 

May need to describe roles of team members, for example: two people working on front-end, two on backend. Or all working on front-end if required.

##### **Project**

###### Clyde River Data Dashboard (Mobile Application) 

This is for our demonstration site on the Clyde River using IoT weather, water salinity and temperature data students would create a Mobile App to display the data from our API. 
The App would display all publicly available Clyde River sensors on a map view with the ability to select a specific sensor to view the most recent telemetry. The app should also allow the user to specify a date range to view historical time series data for both the water quality and weather station data. Weather station data should be formatted to display with the correct aggregates (e.g. 9am to 9am 24hr rainfall sum).

- Discussions with DPI showed some differences to the project description. Specifically, it appears that the project will build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be compiled as a website or mobile app.
- Displaying data pulled from API on a mobile device.
- Need to show depth as part of project proposal, detail the amount of work required.



#### Project management

Discussion on project management. Using Jira. Export a snapshot for each completed iteration and store in version control.

MD asked that the team cc him when emailing DPI so that he can stay across that communication.

#### Individual work

Discussion on recording the relative contributions of team members in a pie graph at the end of each phase (Inception and Elaboration).

#### Meeting time

Already booked in for 17:00 every second Thursday. Meeting time will remain the same from now on.
