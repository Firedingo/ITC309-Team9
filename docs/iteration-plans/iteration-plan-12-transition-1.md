### Objectives Assessment

No objectives were met, all objectives failed on all accounts. For further details on why the dependent criteria were not met, see below.

- Objective 1 is dependent on Criteria 1.
- Objective 2 is dependent on Criteria 2, 3 & 4.
- Objective 3 is dependent on Criteria 5.

### Work Items Assessment

Work Items 11 & 14 were the priority to complete. Followed by Work items 15 & 16 and then 17 & 18 and finally the rest of the work items.

While many of the work items had progress added to them, very few work items were completely finished. Once again progress was slowed down and at times bogged by Work Items 11 & 14.

Overall, about 30% of set items were completed, Amounting to 17/92 hours......that said it's worth noting Item 15 may be overestimated in hours needed which may increase the percentage of completed hours.

Often Work Items are over estimated and delivery comes in at less than that.

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

No Evaluation Criteria were met. Criteria 1 failed on both accounts, Criteria 2 failed on both accounts, Criteria 3 failed on both accounts, Criteria failed to be met because of work item 17 and Criteria 5 failed as a result of Work Item 25. That said, Item 25 was almost complete and could functionally be considered complete given it needed very little to actually complete it.

- Criteria 1 is dependent on Work Items 11 & 14.
- Criteria 2 is dependent on Work Items 15 & 16.
- Criteria 3 is dependent on Work Items 18 & 19.
- Criteria 4 is dependent on Work Item 17.
- Criteria 5 is dependent on Work Items 24, 25 & 26.

### Concerns and Deviations

Concerns remain over whether the team can actually finish in time. While it is clear the team does not struggle with the documentation side of things, the skills clearly most lacking is the programming skill with the team consistently being bogged and slowed down by programming related items.

There is extra concern at the end of this iteration with no objective or criteria met as a result of at least 1 dependent work item not being completed.
