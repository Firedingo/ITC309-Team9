May become a more serious issue if the outage is prolonged. Would impact testing and delivery | Project, Technology, Schedule, Delivery | External Factors, Server-side resources are unresponsive, Data not updated on Client side | Pressing timeline and extended down time or short down time but no clarity when it will be fixed. | Mitigation | If AWS remains down then attempt to move to an alternate provider if a timely solution can't be provided. | If a solution or migration have not or cannot fix the issue, then bring the server-side components in house onto a managed VPS |
| ID | Current Status | Risk Impact | Probability of Occurrence | Risk Map | Risk Description | Project Impact | Risk Area | Symptoms | Triggers | Risk Response Strategy | Response Strategy | Contingency Plan |
| 21 | Open | High | Low | Yellow | The Simple Storage Service (S3) is misconfigured to allow unauthorized access | Unauthorized access could result in any number of issues depending on actions taken by the person with said access. As such, the impact could be minor or quite high. They could do nothing or they could delete everything. | Project, Schedule, Resources, Budget, Delivery | Could be a reference in a log through to the server-side resources being completely inaccessible. | An alert or other indication something is not right | Avoid | Check the Simple Storage Service (S3) is appropriately configured, test potential entry points. Have backups of the contents as necessary or where practical | Restrict All Access, Verify the s3 bucket's contents are ok, then reconfigure the access policy |
| 22 | Open | High | Medium | Red | Lambda Functions Fail To Perform As Expected Due To An Issue Of Some Kind With Them | The impacts here could be broad. From failure to access the FarmDecisionTech API and therefore fail to provide data to incorrect locations and even inaccurate or incorrect data due to a failure to update cached data. | Project, Schedule, Resources, Delivery | Data not updating, errors being returned, Data missing, inaccurate Data | Testing Consistently Fails, the application performs unexpectedly or erratically, Errors are apparent | Mitigate | Check the logic and syntax of the lambda functions, check the status of other components such as FarmDecisionTech API and the CodePipeline | Rewrite the entire lambda functions and seek further help and guidance from other sources |
| 23 | Open | High | Low | Yellow | The CodePipeline Fails Due to Poor Testing And Allows a Dysfunctional Version Of The Application Through | This would be bad, very very bad. Because the impact could easily knock on through large parts of the project and eventually into the end users if not caught and addressed | Project, Schedule, Resources, Budget, Delivery | Poorly defined test cases | Clearly ill defined test cases, poor understanding of what needs testing, the application coming through the CodePipeline with clearly obvious issues. | Avoid | Check the test cases before implementing, Ensure there is a well defined scope and that all aspects of that scope are understood | Implement a Rollback procedure, revisit test cases and implement smoke testing and canary deployments |
| 24 | Open | High | Low | Yellow | The CodePipeline fails at the build/test servers and the Application can't come through | This would be bad as a failure in the CodePipeline would be uncommon and problematic. | Project, Schedule, Resources, Budget, Technology, Delivery | Build/Test Servers Unavailable, errors produced, no application | Servers remain down, solution unable to rectify the problem, project progress is halted | Mitigate | Identify the cause of the downtime, take appropriate action to address this issue | Remove and replace the problematic parts of the build/test servers, up to and including the servers themselves. |
| 25 | Open | High | Low | Yellow | BitBucket Goes Down or otherwise becomes Inaccessible | Big Impact issue but relatively simple fix. | Project, Schedule, Delivery | External Factors Primarily, Repository becomes unavailable or inaccessible | Inaccessible Repository for a longer than desired time - for example 3 days. | Mitigate | Seek clarification on down time and whether work can be continued locally in the mean time. Have a backup repository. | Move local files to a new repository and/or access the backup repository |
| 26 | Open | High | Medium | Red | Inappropriately Configured IAM roles that allow unauthorised access to server-side resources | Potentially Big Impact. Unauthorized access is bad but impact is heavily dependent on what the person does once they have access | Project, Schedule, Budget, Resources, Delivery | Could be a reference in a log through to the server-side resources being completely inaccessible. | An alert or other indication something is not right | Mitigate | Confirm that unauthorized access has happened, identify how that occurred and adjust the IAM role permissions as necessary to remove the issue | Restrict All Access, check all IAM roles and allocated permissions and adjust each one individually as necessary until the issue no longer remains. |
| 27 | Open | Medium | Low | Green | Leakage of OAuth 2.0 tokens or credentials from the API Gateway & OAuth 2.0 credentials blocked by the FarmDecisionTech API | The impact of such tokens would be highly problematic if they fell into the hands of someone untoward. The FarmDecisionTech API could then be spammed thus getting the credentials blocked and preventing data from being retrieved. | Project, Schedule, Resources,  Delivery | Errors returned from the FarmDecisionTech API, Data Not Updating, Other functions not performing as expected | OAuth 2.0 Credentials still being inappropriately used and still getting blocked temporarily by the FarmDecisionTech API | Both Mitigate & Escalate | Remove or Quarantine the leaked OAuth 2.0 credentials, allow the FarmDecisionTech API to remove the restriction on them if applicable and test after some time if the credentials are still being inappropriately used | Remove the leaked OAuth 2.0 credentials and contact DPI to get new OAuth 2.0 credentials for the FarmDecisionTech API |
| 28 | Open | High | Medium | Red | Conflicts Between Team Members Prevent Progress & Delivery of the Project | Big Issue, the impact is quite severe and could potentially cause the failure of the project. | Schedule, Delivery, Resources, Budget, Technology, Project | Poor Communication, Lack Of Respect, Favouritism, Prioritization of certain member's works, Deliberate Actions to Hinder the work of another team member | Little to No Progress happening on the project. Unable to Resolve conflicts and issues between members. | Mitigate | Have a well defined team code of conduct or charter, ensure all members understand and know what is in the charter, ensure accurate records are kept, ensure that dispute resolution mechanisms are included in the team charter and deployed early when issues become apparent. Ensure issues are raised respectfully and promptly. | Source external mediation, Address all members concerns fairly and responsibly and try to find an equitable resolution. Implement a discipline system if and when it is necessary. Remove uncooperative members when and if all other options have been exhausted. |
| 29 | Open | Medium | Low | Green | React Native Charts Wrapper Library is no longer fit for purpose | Impact is problematic but not a project breaker. It has a decent impact on the client side of the application but very little on the server side of the application. | Schedule, Delivery, Resources, Technology, Project | Data is unable to be displayed, Data is slow to display, data is inaccurate when displayed due to the handling by the graph | The React native Charts Wrapper Library is not performing as required and no other solution or fix has addressed the issue | Mitigate | Identify alternative charting and graphing libraries that are compatible, fall back on tables if and as needed. | Replace React Native Charts Wrapper Library with alternative |

## Key

**ID:** A unique ID number used to identify the risk within the tracking log.

**Current Status:**

* Open: the risk is currently open but is not yet an issue.
* Closed: the risk is no longer considered an active project threat and can be closed with or without resolution.

**Risk Impact:**

* High: risk has the potential to greatly impact project cost, schedule, and/or performance.
* Medium: risk has the potential to slightly impact project cost, schedule, and/or performance.
* Low: risk has relatively little impact on project cost, schedule, and/or performance.

**Probability of Occurrence:** Estimates the probability that the risk will at some point become a project issue.

**Risk Map:**

* Green:
    * LL (Low  Probability, Low Impact)
    * LM (Low Probability, Medium Impact)
    * ML (Medium Probability, Low Impact)
* Yellow:
    * LH (Low Probability, High Impact)
    * MM (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
    * HL (High Probability, Low Impact)
* Red:
    * MH (Medium Probability, High Impact)
    * HM (High Probability Medium Impact)
    * HH (High Probability, High Impact)

**Risk Description:** A description of the risk.

**Project Impact:** A description of the potential project impact as a result of the risk.

**Risk Area:** May include project, budget, schedule, delivery, technology, resources, and/or miscellaneous.

**Symptoms:** Specifies the symptoms of risk that may eventually lead to the execution of a risk contingency plan.

**Triggers:** The requirement(s) to execute the contingency plan(s).

**Risk Response Strategy:** Preferred risk response strategy. May include mitigate, avoid, transfer, actively accept, passively accept, and escalate.

**Response Strategy:** An appropriate response strategy to prevent the risk from becoming an issue.

**Contingency Plan:** A description of the risk contingency plan.
