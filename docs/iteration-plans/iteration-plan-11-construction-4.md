### Objectives Assessment

Most high level objectives were not met. Objectives 2 and 5 were met. Most objectives were not met because their evaluation criteria were not met and those criteria were not met due to their corresponding work items not being completed.

- Objective 1 is dependent on criteria 1.
- Objective 2 is dependent on criteria 2 & 4.
- Objective 3 is dependent on criteria 3 & 5.
- Objective 4 is dependent on criteria 6.
- Objective 5 is dependent on criteria 7.
- Objective 6 is dependent on criteria 8.

### Work Items Assessment

Work items 10 & 11 were deemed high priority items to be completed and while significant progress has been made and ultimately the items have been all but met, there is still some outstanding work required to ensure that in particular work item 11 is fully and completely met.

Work item 12 was easily and successfully met with no major issues or complications.

Work item 13 was much more easily completed once a restructure and rewrite of the application was completed.

Work items 14 & 15 are heavily dependent on work items 10 & 11 and therefore progress towards 10 & 11 significantly help increase the progress towards items 14 & 15.

Work Item 16 is low priority but intrinsically connected to criteria 1 & 4.

Work Item 17

### Evaluation Criteria Assessment

Most evaluation criteria was not met. Evaluation criteria 2 and 7 were met. Evaluation criteria is dependent on work items being completed in order to be met. While many items are close to being met and progress has been made, it is ultimately however that the work items were not completed and therefore the criteria was not met. This as mentioned above has also resulted in several high level objectives not being met either.

- Criteria 1 is dependent on work items 10 & 11.
- Criteria 2 is dependent on work item 12.
- Criteria 3 is dependent on work item 13.
- Criteria 4 is dependent on work items 14, 15 & 16.
- Criteria 5 is dependent on work items 13, 14, 16 & 17.
- Criteria 6 is dependent on work items 18 & 19.
- Criteria 7 is dependent on work items 21, 22 & 23.
- Criteria 8 is dependent on work item 20.
