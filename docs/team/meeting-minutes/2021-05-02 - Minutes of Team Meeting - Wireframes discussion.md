### Email from Mostafa

The team discussed the email from the project supervisor regarding the strikes policy.

### Wireframes



#### Map views

The current screens don't include the map views however this will be an essential feature to present to the project sponsor. It will also help the team visualise how they will be integrated. 
The map views might display sensor information overlaid on the map.

BC suggested that a single click/tap on a sensor in the map view might bring up a card (pop-up or overlay) with basic information and then another click/tap could open the sensor page.

#### Select Locations Screen

BC suggested that we modify the "Select Location" screen to include the ability for the user to select favourite locations. CC provided a screenshot of a location selection screen from the BOM app which could be used for inspiration in this regard.

The team should also consider sorting the list of locations based on geolocation proximity (as opposed to alphabetically).

##### BOM Select Locations Screen

#### Settings Screen

The team agreed that a settings screen would not be a necessity as there are not enough settings to warrant it.

#### Landing Page

The suggestion that first time users land on the Select Location screen was met with approval. Subsequent visits to the app would use the user's favourite location if set.

#### Location Screen

The summary cards on the "Location" screen can be selected by the user to access more detailed metrics, graphs, etc.

#### Weather Information

The team discussed whether the app should present all weather information or just related weather information on the weather sensor screen. It was agreed that clicking/tapping a card on the main 'location screen' would take the user to a page for just that weather information. For example, clicking on the rainfall card would open a screen with all rainfall information.

#### Other device screens

The card style layout will allow information to be presented in a grid layout on larger devices with either detailed information or map views appearing beside the cards on much larger screens.

### Next Steps

[**Action:**](#Action-Register) CC to create digital versions of the wireframes.

[**Action:**](#Action-Register) SJ to create a wireframes branch and upload existing drawings and notes.

[**Action:**](#Action-Register) BC to create a document for the sponsor with summaries from other team members.

Meeting closed at 20:29 AEDT.
