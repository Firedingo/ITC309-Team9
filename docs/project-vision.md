# Project Vision

## Introduction
The NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) have commissioned this project to support their Climate Smart Pilot program. They are seeking an improved and mobile friendly way for Clyde River oyster farmers to access environmental information (such as salinity, rainfall, etc.) from data captured by DPI sensors.

## Positioning

### Problem Statement
**The problem of** difficult to access information from DPI sensors  
**affects** Oyster farmers on the Clyde River  
**the impact of which is** underutilisation of DPI information, which impacts planning and production value of the farm.  
**a successful solution would be** an application to improve access to climate and weather information provided by the DPI sensors.

### Product Position Statement
**For** oyster farmers on the Clyde river  
**Who** rely on quick and easy access to climate and weather information  
**The** Clyde River Dashboard is a progressive web application  
**That** offers a responsive and modern user interface to display the required information in the most accessible way  
**Unlike** the current dashboard which requires users to signup to an API and displays data in a less usable format.  
**Our product** will provide a mobile friend, and easy to access solution for viewing information from the DPI sensors.

## Stakeholder Descriptions

### 3.1 Stakeholder Summary
The primary stakeholder is the NSW Department of Primary Industries.

Name            | Description       | Responsibilites
----------------|-------------------|----------------
Ben Sefton      |  Assistant Software Developer - Climate Applications & Digital Agriculture           | Information involving the Clyde River Dashboard and the FarmDecisionTECH API
Matt Pierce     | Agricultural Sensing Technician        | Questions regarding oyster farming
Mostafa Dashan  | Project Supervisor| Assessor

### 3.2 User Environment
Users will primarily be Oyster Farmers on the Clyde River. We have been advised the majority use iOS. 
It is understood a farmer will use this application individually to view sensor data to inform decisions around management of the oyster farm. It is currently unclear how often or how much time is spend viewing this information.

The application will be required to run on various mobile devices with iOS specifically mentioned. The graphs and information will need to be able to scale to be viewed on smaller displays. It is assumed that the application may be accessed outdoors, so contrast and colours should be taken into account to ensure the data can be viewed more easily regardless of external light and glare.

This application is required to integrate with the FarmDecisionTECH API.
